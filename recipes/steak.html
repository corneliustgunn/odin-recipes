<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is a wonderful steak dish that was prepared for me when I lived in Argentina. This Argentinean steak dish is quite popular in various restaurants around Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>high-quality beef taken from the hindquarters of the animal, typically cut into thick slices that are cooked by broiling or frying.</p>


<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1c Red Wine</li>
    <li>1tsp Salt</li>
    <li>1 Sprig Fresh Rosemary</li>
    <li>4 New York Strip Steaks, cut 1-inch Thick</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Combine the red wine, salt and rosemary in a small bowl. Let stand at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
    <li>Heat a large griddle or cast-iron skillet over high heat. Place the steaks on the hot pan, and cook for about 8 minutes per side, or to desired degree of doneness. The internal temperature should be at least 145 degrees F (62 degrees C) for medium rare. Pour in the wine mixture, and allow it to boil for a minute. Serve steaks with sauce on a deep platter.</li>
    
</ol>
